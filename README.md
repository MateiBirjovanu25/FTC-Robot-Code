# FTC-TeamRO040-Robot-Code
The code for FTC Team RO040 "SnakeTech", Rover Ruckus 2019 contest.
<br>
During the period I had worked with Team SnakeTech I have gained a lot of skills including experience utilising the Java programming language, experience with image processing and object detection using DogeCV, as well as hardware skills necessary for building a competitive robot.<br>
The code was written entirely in Java and can be found [here](https://github.com/TeodorSocea/FTC-TeamRO040-Robot-Code/tree/main/FTC-RoverRuckus2019/TeamCode/src/main/java)
